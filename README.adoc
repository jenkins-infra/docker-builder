Its target is to allow building https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec[OCI compliant images] in rootless or daemonless contexts as Kubernetes non privileged pods.

== Build Image

Build the docker image with `docker build -t <name> ./`.

== Test Image

Test the docker image with https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test[Google Container Test] installed:

[source,bash]
container-structure-test test --driver tar --image <name> --config ./cst.yml
